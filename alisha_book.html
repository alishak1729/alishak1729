<body>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a girl named Emma. Emma was a sweet girl. Her family went on a trip, but the family got into a car accident. Luckily, they survived. After one year, the parents got sick! Eventually, they went to the hospital, and the little girl had to beg on the street until a man saw her.</p>
    
    <p>The man adopted her, and he was rich. The man took her and asked about her situation, and she told him. The man was shocked. When it was bedtime, the man couldn't stop thinking about what had happened. He went to the hospital and gave money to save the parents! The next day, the parents surprised Emma. She was so happy. The man gave them $100,000,000!</p>
    
    <p>After that, they were able to buy a house and get an education! One day, she was talking to her friends. After that, she went home. While walking, she saw a puppy on the street. The puppy was sick and had a broken leg. She ran to it, hugged it, and adopted her. She named her Cookie.</p>
    
    <p>Emma took Cookie to the vet. Her leg was fixed, and she wasn't sick anymore. Emma was so happy! She went shopping for her puppy. While shopping, she saw the man who adopted her! She ran into his arms. Ever since that day, they always saw each other every day!</p>
    
    <p>One day, Emma entered a lottery and... she won the lottery! She ran downstairs and told her parents. They were so happy. Another day, while walking with her dog, Emma saw her friend. She ran to her and said, "Hi!" Her friend was sad. Emma hugged her and asked what happened. Emma's friend said, "My brother Max died in the army."</p>
    
    <p>Emma was so shocked! She said, "I'm sorry for you..." "It's okay," said Emma's friend. When it was bedtime, Emma went to bed. The next day, her mom told Emma she was pregnant. Emma was so happy! The baby was kicking, and dad rushed mom to the hospital. It was a girl, and they named her Ivy!</p>
    
    <p>A few years later, Emma turned 11. Her birthday was on August 22. Ivy was now 7, with her birthday on October 12. One day, while the sisters and Cookie were at the park, Ivy said to Emma, "It's getting late, can we go home?" "Okay," said Emma. On the way, they met a boy named Adil. He said, "Hi," and they chatted for a bit, then left.</p>
    
    <p>While walking, Ivy noticed Cookie was missing! The sisters looked left and right, but they couldn’t find her. Ivy was so sad she started crying. Emma was also sad. Then Emma saw something in the distance... it was Cookie! Ivy ran and hugged Cookie! Emma followed and also hugged Cookie. They went home, and on the way, they saw their friend Adil. Emma said, "Hi," and left. They finally got home.</p>
    
    <p>The next day, Emma and Ivy were looking for a car. On the way, they saw Adil again. They said, "Hi," and left. When Ivy was in the toy aisle, Emma found the car aisle. Emma called Ivy, "Hey Ivy, I found the car aisle!" "Ok, geez." "What did you say?" "N-nothing." "GOOD! Now let's go." "Ok, but first, can you buy me this toy, please?" "Ok, ok, fine."</p>
    
    <p>The sisters went to the car aisle. They saw a Cybertruck and bought it! It cost 20 bucks. After that, they bought another car, a Lamborghini. The next day, it was Emma's birthday! It was a Hello Kitty-themed birthday. She invited Adil but not Jake because he was mean. She also invited Blake, Ivy, Lilly, Molly, Max, Zoey, Clover, Sally, Lola, and Alisha. It was so fun!</p>
    
    <p>After that, Emma's birthday was over. The sisters left home. The next day, they had to take Cookie to the vet. Cookie was scared. She ran away, so Ivy and Emma had to chase her all over the house. Emma said, "I have a plan to catch Cookie." Ivy followed Emma to her room. On the way, Ivy asked, "Where are the parents?" "They are on vacation in Hawaii." "NO FAIR!" said Ivy. "Now come on!" "Okay."</p>
    
    <p>After an hour, they finally caught Cookie. They put her in a cage. Cookie tried to escape, but it didn't work, and Cookie got a shot. It turns out it didn’t hurt. Emma, Ivy, and Cookie went home. The next day, mom and dad came home. Ivy asked, "Why didn't you take us to Hawaii?"</p>
    
    <p>"Because you have school," mom replied. "Ok," said Ivy. The next day, Ivy and Emma had a graduation! Ivy said, "Let's have a girls' day, Emma." "Can we please bring Cookie with us?" said Ivy. "Ok, fine," said Emma. "The girls' day is tomorrow," said Emma. "Ok," said Ivy.</p>
    
    <p>The next day, Ivy, Emma, and Cookie woke up and got ready. But when Ivy went to the bathroom, she screamed, "A spider!" Meanwhile, Emma was so happy that she started dancing. Then she heard a scream! She ran to the bathroom and found her sister screaming. Emma asked, "What happened?" "There's a spider!" Ivy screamed. Emma caught the spider with a tissue.</p>
    
    <p>"Ivy, come on, we have to go." "Ok." "Wait!" "What, Ivy?" "We have to get Cookie." "Oh yeah!" The sisters got Cookie, and then they went out in their Cybertruck. They went swimming, to McDonald's, a concert, Disneyland, and the mall! Finally, they came home. Ivy said, "YAY! Emma, can we do it again next Saturday?" "Of course!"</p>
    
    <p>"Thanks! Now go to bed!" "OK! Goodnight." "Goodnight." "Bye!" "Bye!"</p>
    
    <p>The next day, Emma had a friend coming for a sleepover. At night, Ivy asked if she could join with her stuff and pajamas. Emma said, "Ok!" They had so much fun! However, the next day, the parents got in a plane crash. The girls got a phone call. Luckily, they survived, but they had to stay in the hospital for two days. Emma told Ivy, and she was so shocked she started to cry.</p>
    
    <p>Emma said, "Ivy, don't cry. Mom and dad will be in the hospital for only two days." "Ok," said Ivy. "Don't be sad, Ivy, it's okay." "Ok." "Good. Now... PILLOW FIGHT!!!"</p>
    
    <p>The next day, Emma had good news and bad news. She called Ivy, and Ivy ran downstairs. "What happened?" Ivy asked. Emma said, "I have good news and bad news. Which one do you want to hear first?" "I want the good news!" Ivy replied. "Ok! Our parents are coming home tomorrow!" "YAY!" "But the bad news is, we can't have a girls' day." "Why?" "Because I have to take care of the house. Sorry, sis." "It's ok," Ivy said. "Thank you, you're a great sister." "You too, big sis."</p>
    
    <p>The next day, the sisters' parents came back from the hospital! Ivy was sleeping while Emma was awake. She ran and hugged them, crying happy tears. Ivy woke up in a big surprise! She ran and hugged her parents tightly. The next day, the sisters went to the park with Cookie, got ice cream, and had a nice, sweet, fun day!</p>

    <p>THE END!</p>
