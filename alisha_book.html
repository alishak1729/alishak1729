    <p>Hello! My name is Alisha, and I am a 2nd-grade student in elementary school. I love reading books, practicing martial arts, coding, and both reading and writing stories.</p>

    <p> Here is the story I recently wrote, which I hope the audience would enjoy </p>
    
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a girl named Emma. Emma was a sweet girl. Her family went on a trip, but the family got into a car accident. Luckily, they survived. After one year, the parents got sick! Eventually, they went to the hospital, and the little girl had to beg on the street until a man saw her.</p>
    
    <p>The man adopted her, and he was rich. The man took her and asked about her situation, and she told him. The man was shocked. When it was bedtime, the man couldn't stop thinking about what had happened. He went to the hospital and gave money to save the parents! The next day, the parents surprised Emma. She was so happy. The man gave them $100,000,000!</p>
    
    <p>After that, they were able to buy a house and get an education! One day, she was talking to her friends. After that, she went home. While walking, she saw a puppy on the street. The puppy was sick and had a broken leg. She ran to it, hugged it, and adopted her. She named her Cookie.</p>
    
    <p>Emma took Cookie to the vet. Her leg was fixed, and she wasn't sick anymore. Emma was so happy! She went shopping for her puppy. While shopping, she saw the man who adopted her! She ran into his arms. Ever since that day, they always saw each other every day!</p>
    
    <p>One day, Emma entered a lottery and... she won the lottery! She ran downstairs and told her parents. They were so happy. Another day, while walking with her dog, Emma saw her friend. She ran to her and said, "Hi!" Her friend was sad. Emma hugged her and asked what happened. Emma's friend said, "My brother Max died in the army."</p>
    
    <p>Emma was so shocked! She said, "I'm sorry for you..." "It's okay," said Emma's friend. When it was bedtime, Emma went to bed. The next day, her mom told Emma she was pregnant. Emma was so happy! The baby was kicking, and dad rushed mom to the hospital. It was a girl, and they named her Ivy!</p>
