    <p><i><h3>Hello! My name is Alisha, and I am currently a 2nd-grade student in elementary school.
        I wrote a book in the summer vacation of my 1st grade.
        I love reading books, practicing martial arts, coding, and both reading and writing stories.</h3></i></p>

    <p> <i><h3>Here is the story I recently wrote, which I hope the audience would enjoy !! </h3></i></p>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a girl named Emma. Emma was a sweet girl. Her family went on a trip, but the family got in a car accident. Luckily, they survived. After one year, the parents got sick! Eventually, they went to the hospital, and the little girl had to beg on the street!</p>

    <p>Until a man saw her and adopted her. He was rich, and the man took her and asked her story. She told him, and the man was shocked. When it was bedtime, the man couldn't stop thinking about what happened. He went to the hospital and gave money to save the parents!</p>
    
    <p>The next day, the parents surprised Emma. She was so happy. The man gave them $100,000,000! After that, they were able to buy a house and get an education!</p>
    
    <p>One day, she was talking to her friends! After that, she went home, and when she was walking, she saw a puppy on the street. The puppy was sick and had a broken leg. She ran to it, hugged it, and adopted her, naming her Cookie.</p>
    
    <p>Emma took her to the vet, and her leg was fixed. She wasn't sick anymore. Emma was so happy! She went shopping for her puppy. When she was shopping, she saw the man who adopted her! She ran into his arms.</p>
    
    <p>Ever since that day, they always see each other every day! One day, Emma entered a lottery and... she ... won the lottery! She ran downstairs and told her parents, and they were so happy.</p>
    
    <p>One day, Emma was walking with her dog and saw her friend. She ran to her and said, "Hi!" Her friend was sad. Emma ran and hugged her, asking what happened. Emma's friend said, "My brother Max died in the army..."</p>
    
    <p>Emma was so shocked! She said, "I'm sorry for you..." "It's okay," said Emma's friend. When it was bedtime, Emma went to bed, and her mom got pregnant! The next day, her mom told Emma. Emma was so happy.</p>
    
    <p>The baby was kicking, and Dad rushed Mom to the hospital. It was a girl, and they named her Ivy! A few years later, Emma was 11, and her birthday was on August 22. Ivy was 7, and her birthday was on October 12.</p>
    
    <p>One day, when the sisters and Cookie were at the park, Ivy said to Emma, "It's getting late, can we go home?" "Okay," said Emma. On the way, they met a boy named Adil. He said, "Hi," and they chit-chatted for a bit, then left.</p>
    
    <p>When they were walking, Ivy saw Cookie was missing! The sisters looked left and right! But they didn't find her... Ivy was so sad she started crying... Emma was also sad. Emma saw something in the distance. It... it... it was Cookie!</p>
    
    <p>Ivy ran and hugged Cookie! Emma followed, and she also hugged Cookie. They went home. On the way, they saw their friend Adil. Emma said "Hi" and left. They finally got home.</p>
    
    <p>The next day, Emma and Ivy were looking for a car. On the way, they saw Adil. They said "Hi" and left. When Ivy was in the toy aisle, Emma saw the cars. Emma called, "Ivy, hey Ivy, I found the car aisle!"</p>
    
    <p>"Okay, geez," said Ivy. "What did you say?" "N-nothing." "GOOD! Now let's go." "Okay, but first, can you buy me this toy, please?" "Okay, okay, fine."</p>
    
    <p>The sisters went to the car aisle. They saw a Cybertruck! They bought it! It cost 20 bucks. After that, they bought another car—a Lamborghini. The next day, it was Emma's birthday! It was a Hello Kitty birthday. She invited Adil, not Jake (he's mean).</p>
    
    <p>She also invited Blake, Ivy, Lilly, Molly, Max, Zoey, Clover, Sally, Lola, and Alisha. It was so fun! After that, Emma's birthday was over. Then the sisters went home. The next day, the sisters had to take Cookie to the vet.</p>
    
    <p>Cookie was scared. Cookie ran away so she wouldn't have to go to the vet. Ivy and Emma had to chase Cookie all over the house. Emma said, "I have a plan to catch Cookie." Ivy went with Emma to her (Emma's) room.</p>
    
    <p>On the way, Ivy asked Emma, "Where are the parents?" "They are on vacation to Hawaii." "NO FAIR!" said Ivy. "Now, come on!" "Okay." After 1 hour, they finally caught Cookie. They put her in a cage.</p>
    
    <p>Cookie tried to escape the cage, but it didn't work, and Cookie got a shot. Turns out it didn't hurt. Emma, Ivy, and Cookie went home. The next day, Mom and Dad came home.</p>
    
    <p>Ivy said, "Why didn't you bring us to Hawaii?" Mom said, "You have school." "OK," said Ivy. The next day, Ivy and Emma had a graduation! Ivy said, "Let's have a girls' day, Emma." "Emma, can we please bring Cookie with us?" asked Ivy.</p>
    
    <p>"Okay, fine," said Emma. "The girls' day is tomorrow," said Emma. "Okay," said Ivy. The next day, Ivy, Emma, and Cookie woke up and got ready... But when Ivy went to the bathroom, she saw... a spider!</p>
    
    <p>Meanwhile, Emma was so happy that she started dancing, "ayyyyyyyy ay ay aya ayyy." Then she heard a scream! She ran to the bathroom and found her sister screaming. "What happened?" asked Emma. "There’s a spider!" screamed Ivy.</p>
    
    <p>Emma caught the spider with a tissue. "Ivy, come on, we have to go." "Okay, wait!" "What, Ivy?" "We have to get Cookie." "Oh yeah! Come on!"</p>
    
    <p>The sisters got Cookie, then they went in their Cybertruck! They went swimming, to McDonald's, a concert, Disneyland, and the mall! Finally, they came home.</p>
    
    <p>Ivy said, "YAY! Emma, can we do it again next Saturday?" "Of course!" "Thanks!" "Now go to bed!" "OK!" "Goodnight!" "Goodnight!" "Bye!" "Bye!"</p>
    
    <p>The next day, Emma had a friend coming for a sleepover. At night, Ivy asked if she could join with her stuff and pajamas. Emma said, "Okay!" They had so much fun! The parents got in a plane crash... The girls got a phone call. Luckily, they survived, but they had to stay in the hospital for 2 days.</p>
    
    <p>Emma told Ivy, and she was so shocked she started to cry! Emma said, "Ivy, don’t cry. Mom and Dad are in the hospital for only 2 days." "Okay..." said Ivy. "Don’t be sad, Ivy." "I know, please, it's okay..." "Okay."</p>
    
    <p>"Good. Now... PILLOW FIGHT!" The next day, Emma had good news and bad news. Emma called Ivy. Ivy ran downstairs and said, "What happened?" Emma said, "I have good news and bad news. Which one do you want to hear first, good or bad?"</p>
    
    <p>"I want good!" said Ivy. "Okay! Our parents are coming tomorrow." "YAY!!!" "But the bad news is we can’t have a girls' day." "Why?" "Because I have to take care of the house. Sorry, sis."</p>
    
    <p>"It's okay! Thank you, you're really a great sister," said Ivy. "You too, big sis." "Thanks. Now eat your breakfast and get ready for school." "OK!!! Yummy, thanks big sis!" "No problem."</p>
    
    <p>The next day, the sisters' parents came back from the hospital! Ivy was sleeping when Emma was awake. Emma ran and hugged them, crying happy tears. Ivy woke up to a big surprise! She ran and hugged her parents tight.</p>
    
    <p>The next day, the sisters went to the park with Cookie, got ice cream, and had a nice, sweet, good, fun day! THE END!</p>
